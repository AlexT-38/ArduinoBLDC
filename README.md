# ArduinoBLDC
This is a simple Arduino Nano based BLDC driver, intended for use as a starter/generator.

The desiged is intended to use spare components from older projects, 
but with the intent of moving from "Nano" to "Blue Pill" at some point.

The output is sinusoidal, generated by three channels of 8 bit PWM at 31kHz
Waveform frequency range is currently 11.1 to 187 Hz
Output waveforms are synchronised to hall sensor inputs.
Output current will be controlled by adjusting the output phase.

Interface is USART 1Mbaud 8n1.
